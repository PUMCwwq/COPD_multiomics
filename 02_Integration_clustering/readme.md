# Integration and clustering
The Similar Network Fusion (SNF) method was applied to 159 COPD samples, integrating radiomics, microbiomics, metabolomics, and genomics data. Briefly, network-based multi-omics data fusion and patient-based clustering were implemented using the R-package SNFtool (v2.1). Spectral clustering (implemented within the SNFtool package) was applied to the “fused similarity matrix” to obtain clusters corresponding to k values ranging from 2 to 10. (Integration_clustering.R)
