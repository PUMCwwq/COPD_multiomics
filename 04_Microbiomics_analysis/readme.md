# Microbiomics analysis
We first analyzed the relative abundance of microbial communities at the phylum and genus levels across three subtypes. We then assessed the contribution of environmental and host-related factors to the variation in microbiome composition using adonis RÂ² analysis. (adonis_analysis.R)
Next, we constructed a microbial co-occurrence network based on Spearman correlation coefficients. We applied the Louvain algorithm in Gephi (v0.10.1) to detect modular structures within the network, network complexity and key taxa were examined. Functional prediction of these key taxa was performed using PICRUSt. (network_analysis.R, PICRUSt_prediction.py)
Finally, we explored the correlation between the abundance of microbial genera and immune-related cell indices derived from routine blood tests. The results were visualized using dot plots. (immune_correlation.R)
